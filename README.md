# MacroCycle AI Agent

An autonomous macro-economic intelligence assistant that integrates multiple public data feeds to analyse key macro indicators, liquidity conditions and volatility measures for inferring business cycle stages.

**Created by:** [Bandhu Das FCCA](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ibpdas/)  
**Built for learning, analysis and experimentation - not finacial advice**

**Purpose**

MacroCycle was developed as a testbed for AI agent capability, data infrastructure, and ethical governance ‚Äî exploring how autonomous, explainable systems can support evidence-based decision-making.

While the prototype focuses on macro-economic indicators, the same architecture and design principles can be repurposed for wider environmental missions, including circular economy modelling, natural capital accounting, and sustainability analytics.

It demonstrates how AI agents can be safely adopted to:

- automate data workflows,
- ensure reproducibility and transparency, and
- operationalise responsible data and AI practices at scale.


## What Does MacroCycle Do?

MacroCycle demonstrates the potential of an AI-driven macro-intelligence agent ‚Äî combining open data, structured reasoning, and explainable automation:

- **Automate Key Metrics**: Continuously fetches and processes economic indicators from FRED, CBOE, and Yahoo Finance
- **Infers & Analyses**: Uses algorithms to classify business-cycle phases (Expansion, Peak, Contraction, Trough) using rule-based logic and confidence scoring
- **Generates Natural Language Answers**: Uses OpenAI‚Äôs LLM to summarise macro conditions and answer plain-English questionss
- **Enables Self-Service Analysis**: Let diverse users with varying knowledge levels to explore macro-economic relationships interactively
- **Ensures Reprducability and Transparency**: Built on open data, versioned outputs, and a serverless, modular architecture orchestrated through GitHub Actions.

## Key Features

### Dashboard
- **6 Themes**: Business Cycle, Macro Economics, Liquidity & Credit, Market Sentiment, Market Structure, Sectors & Assets
- **Real-time Indicators**: GDP, unemployment, inflation, ISM PMI, yield curves, VIX, M2 money supply, and more
- **Interactive Visualisations**: Charts with plain English explanations

### AI Research Agent
- **Autonomous Actions**: AI can fetch data, create visualizations, and suggest navigation autonomously
- **Economic Context Awareness**: Access to 12+ key metrics for data-driven responses
- **Educational Insights**: Historical patterns framed as insights, not predictions
- **Conversation History**: Multi-turn natural language conversations

### Business Cycle Analysis
- **Phase Classification**: Determines current cycle stage using GDP, unemployment, inflation, and ISM PMI
- **Historical Backtesting**: Compares current conditions with past cycles
- **Portfolio Insights**: Historical asset allocation patterns across cycle phases
- **Sector Patterns**: Tracks sectors that historically outperformed/underperformed in each phase

### Market Data
- **Sector Performance**: Tracks 11 S&P 500 sectors plus alternative assets (Gold, Bitcoin, DXY)
- **Sentiment Indicators**: VIX, Put/Call Ratio, VVIX, HY-IG Spread, ETF Flows, AAII Survey
- **Fear & Greed Index**: Educational approximation using CNN's 7-indicator methodology

### Resources
- Curated collection of official data sources, academic materials, policy resources, and recommended reading

SESSION_SECRET = "any_random_string_for_session_management"
```

4. **Run the application:**
```bash
streamlit run app.py --server.port 5000
```

5. **Open your browser:**
Navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

## Data Sources

- Experimental - Not an official government product or analysis. 

## üî¨ MacrCycle Prototype Learnings:

This prototype demonstrates critical challenges in deploying autonomous AI agents:

### Overall Challenges
1. **Scalability & Architecture**: Extending the prototype to handle higher frequency and multi domain, multi modal data (e.g., economic, environmental, geospatial) while maintaining modular, serverless design
2. **Data Provenance & Management**: Ensuring lineage tracking and metadata consistency for trust and reuse
3. **Human Oversight & Accountability**: Embedding expert review into automated inference to balance machine efficiency with contextual judgemen 
4. **FinOps & Sustainability**: Managing API usage, cloud costs, and computational efficiency in line with sustainablity practices
5. **Security & Compliance**: Ensuring adherence to data protection standards when integrating external or sensitive datasets
6. **Explainability & Transparency**: Making all AI driven insights interpretable, auditable, and explainable for public sector decision-making 

### Data Ethics Considerations
- **Representation & Bias**: Data reflects inherent economic and geographic biases. Future iterations or similar use cases such as Circular Economy will need diversify inputs to improve fairness
- **Synthetic Data Boundaries**: Approximations and proxies (e.g., ISM PMI, Fear & Greed Index) are clearly labelled and used for demonstration only
- **Responsible use of insights**: Dashboards emphasise interpretation over prediction to reduce anchoring and confirmation bias 

### Data Policy Implications
MacroCycle highlights emerging data governance priorities for AI-enabled analysis and public-sector reuse:
- **Transparent Data Lineage** ‚Äì every indicator and transformation should be traceable and versioned for accountability
- **Interoperable Data Models** ‚Äì Open formats and shared metadta to enable reuse across sectors and domains
- **Responsible AI Use** ‚Äì embedding explainability, bias checks, and human-in-the-loop review into automated pipelines
- **Sustainable Data Operations** ‚Äì balancing innovation with environmental and financial cost awareness (FinOps)
- **Ethical Reuse of Open Data** ‚Äì ensuring public datasets are used in ways that build trust, not distort evidence
